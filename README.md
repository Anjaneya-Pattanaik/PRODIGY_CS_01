# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher Python Program
This program allows you to encode and decode text using the Caesar cipher algorithm. It is represented as a recurring menu program.

Introduction:
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features:
Encode plaintext to ciphertext by specifying an offset.
Decode ciphertext back to plaintext by using the same offset.
Handles both lowercase and uppercase letters.
Skips non-alphabetic characters during encryption/decryption.

Usage:
Run the program.
Choose from the available options:
1- Encode text
2- Decode text
3- Exit
When encoding or decoding, enter the text and the desired offset (within the range of -26 to 26, inclusive).
View the result.
